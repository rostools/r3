# r3

The goal of r3 is to provide helper functions for several `r-cubed` R
workshops.

## Installation

You can install the released version of r3 from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("rostools/r3", upgrade = TRUE)
```

## Using or modifying for workshops based on r-cubed

If you want to run your own version of the workshop and would like to
use this helper package for the workshop, you'll likely want to modify
it. While many functions don't need to be modified for your own
workshop, there are several that will need to be, especially:

-   Any of the `open_feedback_*` functions in the `R/open-links.R` file:
    The Google Form (or other survey platform) URLs should be replaced
    to the one you will use for the workshop.

Check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for other details
about contributing or working with this package.
